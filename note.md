vps, mongodb database atlas url, twilio, domain, s3 bucket
vps, domain from hostinger
s3 bucket from digital ocean
twilio
```

block feature:

1. dont get activity from both blocked direction
2. don't get account on people here
3. conflicting from activity member viewing: and chat messages from group

think when user create one activity,
it can be private or public,

how can this user chat with this activity group,

will automatic this come to that creator rooms,

?

```
Chat Room Becomes Accessible: User can now access the group chat room via:
ts
GET /chat/group/:activityId



here is the culprit bro.

think creator approve,

still user needs to hit get request /chat/group/activityid,


i need to auto this don't want hit this,

think normally how a general use hit this api,

i need real time,


creator approve, automatic  joiner room created or added, and real time refreshes message rooms so  he can immediate come to messages,

clarify me.
